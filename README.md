# Live Project 2 - Selenium WebDriver Framework with Apache POI

Welcome to my Live Project 2 repository! This project is an extension of the Selenium WebDriver framework developed in Live Project 1, introducing new features such as Excel data-driven testing and a comprehensive login test. Here's an overview of this project:

## Project Overview

### Framework Basis

This project is built upon the foundation of the Selenium WebDriver framework created in Live Project 1, inheriting the following key features:

- **Page Object Model (POM)**: The framework continues to adhere to the POM design pattern for maintaining reusable and maintainable page objects.

- **Base Class**: A Base Class is included for shared methods and configurations to ensure code consistency and reusability.

- **Properties File**: Global configurations and variables are stored in a `.properties` file, simplifying management.

- **TestNG Integration**: The project uses TestNG for efficient test case management, parallel execution, and reporting.

### New Features

1. **Apache POI Integration**: I've introduced Apache POI,  to enable data-driven testing. This addition streamlines the management of test data by extracting it from Excel spreadsheets.

2. **Login Test with Test Store**: To replicate real-world scenarios, a comprehensive login test has been implemented using the Test Store. This test validates user login functionality using a combination of email addresses and passwords stored in an Excel spreadsheet.

3. **New Page Object Classes**: I've created two new page object classes: one for the login page and another for the account page that represents the user's state when signed in. These page objects enhance test readability and maintainability.

4. **Test Data Retrieval from Excel**: A new test class has been added to connect to the Excel spreadsheet, retrieve test data, and perform data-driven testing for the login scenario.

Thank you for reviewing my Live Project 2. I believe this project demonstrates my skills in test automation, framework development, and data-driven testing using Apache POI in a real-world context.
